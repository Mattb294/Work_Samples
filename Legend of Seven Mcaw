A video depicting non-verbally and without words a traditional culturally signficatn tale of Hunahpú and Xbalanqué within the Popol Vuh of the K'iche people.
Within the video I edited all the images to create the visual effects, created the movemnt within with adoboe Premiere Pro, and found the royalty free music.
