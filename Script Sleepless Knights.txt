INT. MASTER BEDROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR. -NIGHT

GREG (mid thirties) lies alone in a king-sized bed on the side closest to the exit to the room.

Greg's eyes open suddenly, his vision goes wild but he is able to eventually scan the room calmly.

Greg's vision passes over a tall shadowy humanoid figure across from him. His vision whiplashes back to that space.

It's gone now.

Greg notices to his left the large shadowy figure emerge in front of the nightstand that has a picture of his late wife in police uniform, the picture frame is adorned with a medal.

Emerging is an eight-foot-tall humanoid shadow figure with a round head, two distant star-like lights for eyes, long arms that stretch past the knees ending in large hands with elongated fingers ending in razor sharp claws.

The sleep paralysis demon opens its mouth revealing white razor sharp double-layer shark like teeth.

                SHADOWY FIGURE
    Greg...
The sleep paralysis demon leans in closer towards Greg. This sleep paralysis demon named PEEP turns to sit on the empty side of the bed and looks over its shoulder at Greg.

                PEEP
    Your little one took a bite of my ice-cream in the freezer.

                GREG
    Peep, Suzy's five she sees ice-cream she wants it and is that how you say hi after three weeks of paralysis free sleep.

                PEEP
    Yeah, yeah, just letting ya know your little one's sneakin' sweets that aren't hers. Might lead to worse later, who knows?

                GREG
    Margaret is rolling in her grave from that thought alone.

                PEEP
    Yeah, never really met her but I could tell she was a good mate for you. By the way. Keep your little one indoors, some rabid raccoons are picking fights with everything out there.
Greg looks past Peep to the second-floor window. Greg sees his NEIGHBOR putting trash away for the night in his backyard when the raccoons suddenly surround him. The neighbor grabs a rake leaning on the wall and points it out at the raccoons.

                NEIGHBOR
    HONEY, GET THE SHOTGUN WITH ROCK SALT SHELLS NOW!!!!

A raccoon lunges at the neighbor and he bats it away midair. The neighbor runs out of sight with the raccoons in pursuit.

                PEEP
    They win almost every time.

                GREG
    Thanks for the warning, don't want her to come back in to the house with one of those asking if she could keep it.
Greg and Peep hear a door in the hallway creak open followed by a soft pitter patter noise that gets closer.

                GREG
    Peep outta sight now.
Peep frantically and literally folds, and squeezes then blends with the shadows under Greg’s bed.

Greg’s master bedroom door shrieks open and Greg’s daughter SUZY(five-years-old) in pink pajamas steps into the room.

                SUZY
    Daddy, there's a monster in my closet.

                GREG (O.S)
    Oh, that sounds scary. Why don't you sleep next to me tonight?
Suzy enthusiastically climbs up on Greg’s side of the bed and then over him, unintentionally kneeing his stomach painfully in the process. Suzy falls asleep quickly in the empty space on the bed.

                GREG
    Peep, what do you think? Think it's Suzy's imagination?
Peep looking in Greg’s direction suddenly looks over to the doorway. Peep catches a glimpse of something with varying shades of grey with yellow horns duck out of his view.

                PEEP
    Not entirely sure.
INT. KITCHEN. -DAY.

Greg is making pancakes for him and Suzy this morning as Suzy draws with crayons in a kitchen nook.

When Greg turns around with two completed platters of pancakes. He notices Suzy has disappeared without a trace and Greg's vision looks frantically around the kitchen for Suzy.

Greg walks to where she disappeared and out from under the kitchen nook's table Suzy’s little hand grabs his ankle while holding her drawing in her other hand.

                SUZY
    Rooooaaarrr!!!
Greg lets out a sigh of relief, puts the pancakes on the table, then lifts Suzy up in both arms. He playfully touches her nose and chuckles.

                GREG
    You got me kiddo. Almost gave me a heart attack.

Suzy laughs at her dad’s emotional misfortune but that laugh suddenly turns into a long drawn out yawn.

                GREG
    Everything OK?

                SUZY
    I'm sleepy.

                GREG
    Well you've been coming to sleep next to me for the past three nights and when you do it's late.

                SUZY
    Can't help it.

                GREG
    Why can't you help it?

                SUZY
    It get's closer.

                GREG
    What get's closer?
Suzy almost hits her dad in the face with her drawing as she shows it to him.

It’s a crude crayon drawing with Suzy on one side standing on her bed, her late mother MARGARET hovering above, and her father standing stoically in front of her bed. Greg can’t help but smile at the drawn Margaret but frowns at the sight of the drawn closet.

The drawn closet is open, light and dark grey striped three fingered claws are sticking out of from the darkness.

                GREG
    Is this what has been bothering you?
Suzy buries her face into Greg's shoulder and shakes her head in a "yes" while tightening her grip on her dad.

As Greg slides into the kitchen nook he gently places Suzy in front of her chocolate milk and pancakes.

                GREG
    Well don't worry your little head about that, this masterpiece is going on the fridge anyway. You excited for Kindergarten next week?
Suzy sleepily prods her pancakes completely tired as Greg looks at her worried.

                GREG
    Well after your pancakes you go outside and play.
Greg spots one of the raccoons in the backyard through the kitchen window. The raccoon notices Greg and stares back at him, foam froths out of its mouth that carries a squirrel. The raccoon then leaps over the fence out of sight.

                GREG
    Stay indoors and watch Elmo.
Suzy sleepily nods then rolls up a pancake and dunks it into the chocolate milk. The chocolate milk waterfalls onto the table then into Greg’s lap as Suzy takes her first bite.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR. -NIGHT

In the master bedroom Greg lies in bed as stiff as a board looking at Peep who is leaning against a wall to Greg’s left.

                GREG
    So you think she's gonna be friends with whatever it is like we are?

                PEEP
    I mean that would be the best case scenario.
INT. YOUNG GREG'S ROOM CHILDHOOD HOME. -NIGHT -FLASHBACK.

We are now in the rock band and movie poster strewn room of a twelve year old YOUNG GREG.

Twelve-year-old YOUNG GREG lies in his poster covered room when sleep paralysis causes his eyelids to rapidly open. Young Greg goes into a heavy breathing panic before calming down and attempting but failing to move.

                YOUNG GREG
    So this is sleep paralysis. Cool.
Young Greg’s curiosity is taken to the edge of his bed as something under it shakes the bed and grunts.

Peep who doesn’t look any different struggles to pull himself out from under the bed. It only takes Greg a glance of Peep to cause him to panic.

                YOUNG GREG
    Not cool. Not cool.
With a comedic pop Peep fully emerges. Peep is surprised to see Greg whose face is twisted into a silent wide-eyed scream. Peep points and mockingly smiles at young Greg with his fear.

Peep then turns away claws over his face before suddenly turning around to face Greg inches away from his own face. Peep mockingly imitates Greg’s fear by imitating his fearful expression. Greg’s horror intensifies and Peep starts shaking his head back and forth in more mockery.

Peep is now leaning on the wall next to a dresser with a birthday balloon that wasn’t there before resting on it. Greg tries to move but only causes his bed to violently and comically shake.

Peep curiously looks at the balloon before slowly proceeding to poke it causing it to instantly pop. Greg glares at Peep, while Peep looks shamefully at the ground.

                PEEP
    Sorry about that.

                YOUNG GREG
    Yeah, whatever.

                PEEP
    So you are what 13 human cycles now? Congrats.

                YOUNG GREG
    Thanks, I guess.

                PEEP
    (beat) Got anything to eat?

                YOUNG GREG
    Got left over cake, you eat right?

                PEEP
    I think so, I mean I can taste the smell of your domain here. It's nasty.

                YOUNG GREG
    Well you can have some cake on two conditions. Quiet and bring me a slice.
Peep bursts into a grin, gives a double thumbs up toward Greg and bolts for the door. Peep stops at the door when Greg speaks.

                GREG
    It's Greg by the way.

                PEEP
    Peep.
Peep slowly exits the room and quietly closes the door.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR. -NIGHT

Both Greg and Peep are nostalgically looking at the ceiling of the master bedroom.

                PEEP
    I can still taste that cake like it was yesterday.

                GREG
    Peep even if it turns out like that. I can’t have late night play-dates turn her into a half-asleep day time zombie. Especially since she starts kindergarten next week. Can't you do something?

                PEEP
    Greg I ain’t no sandman also I don’t really wanna risk your little one seeing me. I rather you not pay for and her go through little one therapy.

                SUZY(O.S)
    AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
Suzy is heard screaming from her room with a loud thud falling close behind. Greg begins to convulse as he fights against the weights of sleep paralysis. Peep begins to pull Greg up by the arms as Suzy's screams get louder.

                GREG
    DON'T HELP ME, HELP HER!
Peep let's Greg's arms drop and races out of the room.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. -NIGHT

Peep takes long strides through the dark second-floor hallway before quickly reaching the final door on the left covered in kitten stickers.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. -NIGHT

Greg begins to violently shake in his attempt to get some kind of movement out of his sleep paralysis.

                GREG
    Out of all the nights it had to be a sleep paralysis one making me useless!
Greg stops shaking to focus on his right hand. The pinkie moves just little bit. Greg seems victorious but that moment leaves suddenly as he realizes he only moved a pinkie.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. -NIGHT

Peeps peeks into Suzy’s room and spots her being dragged to the closet by elongated furry, dark and light grey striped three fingered claws wrapped around her ankles. Peep hesitates to enter.

                PEEP
    I go in she sees me she gets potentially traumatized. I don’t, she gets eaten. Think Peep Think!
Peep hand bangs on the door with frustration then a guttural grunt on the other side is heard. The grunt catches Peeps attention and sees the MONSTER's arms monetarily pause his dragging due to the sudden sound.

Peep proceeds to rapidly bang on the door as he reaches into the room to quickly switch on the light. The sudden light and sound causes the monster's arms to snake away from Suzy.

Suzy Picks herself up and rushes for the door Peep is behind. Peep retreats into a hallway bathroom at the same time Suzy runs crying out of her room.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. -NIGHT

Suzy bursts into Greg’s room an incoherent crying mess of fear as she climbs onto Greg’s bed, over him, and then buries her face into her father’s side crying.

                GREG
    Suzy it’s all right, it’s all right, you’re OK, it’s OK.
Adrenaline and exhaustion leads Suzy into a surprisingly quick sleep. Greg's comfort get's quieter.

                GREG
    It’s ok Suzy. It’s ok kiddo. It’s. It’s not ok. What am I supposed to do like this?
Peep quietly steps into the room as Greg starts to have a quiet breakdown. Peep glares into the direction of Suzy’s room then looks back to Greg to place a claw on his shoulder.

INT. SUZY'S ROOM. -NIGHT

Suzy’s closet door creaks open slowly, from the void the same claws from the night before elongate slowly as they emerge.

                PEEP(V.O)
    I ain't no expert on these things but I know salt burns things like it. So a circle of the stuff may stop it.
The monsters claws reach and stretch further into the room.

                GREG(V.O)
    I'll tell Suzy it's fairy dust but I doubt a little seasoning is gonna stop it permanently.
The claws move over the pink rug at the foot of her bed.

                PEEP(V.O)
    That's why I'm gonna be there. When it makes itself known.

                GREG(V.O)
    Hey, I don't want my daughter seeing to nightmares bloodily tear into each other.
Suzy has the covers over her head and is shaking due to fear.

                PEEP(V.O)
    Well don't you humans tell your little ones to hide under blankets for protection.

The claws pass over the circle of salt and begin to bubble and steam. The claws suddenly recoil to the closet as the monster bursts forth lifting his claws to its face roaring in pain. Suzy screams at the noise.

The monster’s arms and legs are disproportionately lean compared to the torso and the overly large watermelon shaped head makes it the same height as Peep. The monsters face is hairless, with a bear like nose, bright red eyes, a wide mouth stretching to each pair of two yellow horns on either side of its large head with needle like teeth.

                GREG(V.O)
    Alright but if I don't have sleep paralysis tonight. I'm her father I'm fighting.
During the roar the sound of rapid footsteps are heard in the hallway and Suzy’s door is kicked open. Standing in the doorway is Peep who points to the monster in the closet.

                PEEP
    No midnight snack for you, you SPAWN OF A!
Peep reminds himself that young Suzy is in the room.

                PEEP
    BAD THING!

Peep lunges forward with violent resolve.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. -NIGHT

Greg can hear Peep's chaotic fight and Suzy screaming all within her room. Greg looks at his hand with determined focus.

                GREG
    Margaret give me strength. If I lose both of you I wouldn't be able to face you and Suzy when my time comes.

Greg’s hand moves entirely.

INT. SUZY'S ROOM. -NIGHT

Peep stands in between Suzy and the monster. The monster’s head cocks in curiosity. Peep gets the unspoken question.

                PEEP
    Don’t care if it’s a human. I’m helping my only friend not lose what it has left. You ain't touchin' this little one again!
The monster lunges, Peep ducks outs of the way and they turn as they pass each other. Peep uses the turning momentum to swing a fist around to knock the monster down.

The monster's butt lands on the salt and it quickly gets up screaming and rubbing its butts in pain. It looks towards Peep realizing it can’t block doing this. Peep pushes it down on the salt again it lets loose a higher pitched painful monster scream. Mid- monster scream Suzy screams from under the covers.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. -NIGHT

Greg has begun rocking from shoulder to shoulder to build momentum getting closer to throwing himself to the edge of the bed.

                GREG
    Just a little more. You ain't gonna face this thing alone Peep!
INT. SUZY'S ROOM. -NIGHT

The monster’s arms have coiled themselves around Peeps neck from behind. Peep loosens a coil enough to allow him to bite down and rip out a mouthful of fur.

The monster uncoils its arms from around Peeps neck in pain as Peep spits back the ripped-up fur in a fur-ball into the monster’s face. The monster wipes off the wet fur-ball in disgust.

                MONSTER
    Eww grody! Why would you that?!

Peep throws out a right hook knocking the monster down again.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM. -NIGHT

Greg slams onto the floor of his master bedroom. He begins to combat crawl crudely and stiffly into the hallway.

INT. SUZY'S ROOM. -NIGHT

The monster straddles Peep and begins to strangle Peep by wrapping its claws around Peep’s neck. Peep fails to break the monsters grip and proceeds to grab any item within reach.

Peep grabs a hold of a plastic dollhouse.

                PEEP
    Let's play house!!
With a swift motion Peep fits the dollhouse over the monster’s head.

The monster gets up off of Peep as is struggles to pull the doll house of its head. The monster's struggle leads it to stumble out into the hallway. Peep follows in pursuit.

                PEEP
    We're not done here yet you spawn of a bad thing!
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. -NIGHT

Peep stops in his tracks as he reaches the hallway. Peep spots Greg crudely crawling through the hallway and Peep begins to proudly cry his lip quivering.

The monsters struggles to remove the dollhouse from its head and makes it stumble to the top of the staircase where it is met by Greg. Just when it removes the dollhouse Greg has gripped an ankle with both hands.

                GREG
    DON'T MESS WITH MY KID!!
With one powerful and quick pull Greg pulls one of the monsters leg out from under it causing it to avalanche down the stairs.

INT. FIRST FLOOR BASE OF STAIRS. -NIGHT

The monster painfully gets up from it’s fall and looks at the top of the staircase. Peep and Greg glare down at it.

                GREG
    Peep, get this thing out of my house. So me and Suzy can sleep peacefully at night.

                PEEP
    I’d do it even if it meant giving up all the cake in the human world.
Peep pounces from the top of the stairs landing directly on the monster. Peep grabs it by the back and lifts it over his head before throwing it out the window.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF HOUSE. -NIGHT

The monster explodes out of the window. It picks itself back up but suddenly stops when it hears chittering and hisses. The monster slowly turns around as the raccoons lunge at it.

EXT. NEIGHBORS BACKWARD. -NIGHT

The raccoon covered monster breaks through the wooden fence into the neighbor’s backyard. The monster is able to pull one raccoon off its face but it still painfully pulls at the monsters nose. The monster hears a shotgun pump and slowly turns around to face a shotgun wielding bandaged neighbor.

                NEIGHBOR
    The raccoons are getting bigger!
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. -NIGHT

A shotgun blast is heard echoing into the night as Greg lays at the top of the stairs while Peep stands near the broken window. They both wait to see if the monster will return.

Satisfied that it will not come back from the shotgun blast. Peep begins to make his way up the stairs.

                PEEP
    Good to see you finally up and about.

                GREG
    How long have you been saving that one?

Peep picks up Greg in both arms upon reaching the top.

                PEEP
    Never thought I'd actually say it but Twenty human cycles at the least.

                GREG
    Well it was bad and wasn't worth it.
INT. SUZY'S ROOM. -NIGHT

Suzy peeks out from under the covers and sees through her door Peep carrying Greg.

                PEEP
    Shut up you at least found it a little funny.

                GREG
    Yeah.
Suzy grabs her pillow and races off her bed and out of the room into the hall.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. -NIGHT

Suzy immediately confronts Peep by hitting his butt with her pillow repeatedly.

                SUZY
    LET GO OF MY DADDY! DO NOT EAT MY DADDY!

                GREG
    Suzy. Suzy. SUZY!
Greg in Peeps arms is able to get Suzy’s attention halting her assault. Suzy gives Greg a worried look.

                GREG
    Don't worry kiddo, this is uh, this is Peep. He's like an uncle, I guess.
Suzy suddenly looks at Peep with wide-eyed surprise. Greg is able to beckon his head toward Suzy motioning for Peep to introduce himself. Peep leans forward toward Suzy.

                PEEP
    Hello little one I'm Peep.
INT. MASTER BEDROOM. -NIGHT

Peep enters the master room and gently places Greg on his usual spot on his bed. Suzy again painfully climbs over her father.

Suzy curls up into a ball and slowly closes her eyes to try to sleep. Peep puts a claw to his chin in contemplative thought. Peep then lifts Greg’s arm closet to Suzy and gently wraps it around her.

                PEEP
    Good night, sleep tight, you two scream if there's a monster to fight
As Peep quietly leaves, he sees Greg give him a quick thumbs up with his free arm.

INT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY. -NIGHT

Peep goes down the stairs three steps at a time. A freezer door is heard opening and then closing. Peep climbs back up the stairs with a pint of ice cream in his claw.

Peep leans against Greg’s door. Peep lifts the pint to his mouth and takes a bite of it carton and all.

Peep can hear Greg talk to Suzy behind him in the master bedroom.

                GREG
    It's OK kiddo. We're fine now. Knowing Uncle Peep I know he's standing watch.

At the mention of "Uncle Peep" Peep breaks into a large proud smile ice cream dripping from his mouth.

INT. MASTER BEDROOM ON THE SECOND FLOOR. -NIGHT

Greg is sitting up in bed back supported by the wall and Peep is leaning on his usual wall spot. Through the window into the neighbors backyard is a freshly filled in grave with horns sticking out of it.

                GREG
    Yeah things are going well at kindergarten for her.
The master bedroom door opens and Suzy in her pink pajamas stands in the doorway.

                GREG
    Is everything OK kiddo, is the monster back?

                SUZY
    I want a story.
Peep chuckles to himself as he gets up from the wall. As he walks toward Suzy he waves a claw dismissively to Greg as Peep passes the foot of the bed.

                PEEP
    I got this one. You rest easy Greg.

When Peep reaches Suzy at the door she gently takes his pinkie finger in her hand as they begin to walk into the hallway.

                SUZY
    Can I take you to show and tell Uncle Peep?

                PEEP
    Sorry little one but I'm not sure If I can go to your kind-a-garden but hey why don't you take those colorful scribbles you make?
Greg watches as they leave the room. Greg stiffly lowers himself into his bed. He looks to the picture of his late wife and smiles. He then turns to look at the ceiling and hears Suzy laugh in her room to Peeps story. He can't help but chuckle to himself. Greg then peacefully closes his eyes.
